The odds of surviving more than 12 months was 1.8 times greater in dogs that received radiotherapy, compared to dogs that did not receive radiotherapy. This effect was statistically significant (p=0.0.4). However, although the upper limit of the 95% confidence was 3.2, the lower  limit was 1.04. If the true value is near this lower value, it would suggest there is very little clinical benefit to the use of radiotherapy. Therefore, further research is needed to provide a more precise estimate of the true effect of radiotherapy.\nMore \u2018complicated\u2019 data\nThe data considered here are both binary\nBoth methods (chi-square test and regression) will work if the explanatory variable has >2 categories\nBoth methods will work if the outcome variable has >2 categories\nBUT,  other forms of regression will be needed (i.e. multinomial or ordinal regression, instead of logistic regression)"
