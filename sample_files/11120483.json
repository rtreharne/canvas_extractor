A \u201cstride\u201d is one cycle of limb movement at a particular gait. Gait \nrefers to a particular foot-fall pattern (walk, trot, gallop, etc.). Gait is selected for efficiency, \nterrain, and various circumstances related to survival.  \n  \nRunning success is ultimately about speed (catching prey & escaping predators). Speed \nis obtained by maximizing stride rate and stride length. Stride length is gained by increasing \nlimb length, either anatomically or virtually (via physiological trunk flexion/extension). Stride \nrate is favored by reducing limb mass, especially distally. (NOTE: For linear acceleration, inertia \n= mass; for angular acceleration, inertia = mass x radial-distance2.) Stride length and stride rate \nare antagonistic\u2014enhancing one impairs the other; thus, compromise is necessary.   \n  \nTo improve stride rate, distally positioned limb mass can be reduced anatomically \n(permanently) and/or physiologically (temporary limb flexion). Anatomical strategies include: \nconcentrating musculature proximally, reducing number of digits, and elongating the distal, \nleast massive segments of the limb. Physiologically, distal limb mass is reduced by flexing the \nlimb during protraction. The degree of physiological limb flexion is proportional to the speed of \nthe gait, minimal at a walk and maximal at a gallop.  \n  \nBelow, we will first consider general anatomical adaptations associated with running, \nfocusing initially on forelimbs and then on forelimb-hindlimb differences. Next, we will discuss \nconstraints imposed by the carnivore vs herbivore lifestyle. (Locomotion and digestion are linked \nin evolution.) Finally, for the fun of it, we will compare digestive tracts of carnivores (dog) and \nherbivores (ruminants and the horse)  \n \n \n2  \nLimb adaptations for running:   \n  \n  \nAnatomically, cursorial adaptation has involved limb elongation and musculoskeletal \nmodification away from a more primitive, flexible, grasping, multi-use limb design toward a \nmore specialized, stable, locomotion-dedicated limb support. All limb design involves \nanatomical compromises between flexibility (rotation, dexterity, manipulation capacity) and \nstability (joint support, secure surface-contact). Anatomical specialization has evolved to \ninclude different functional roles for thoracic and pelvic limbs.   \n  \nGeneralized limb anatomy (evident in non-cursorial mammals, reptiles & birds)  \n\u2022 scapula positioned dorsally on a dorsoventrally flattened thorax   \n\u2022 shoulder joint fixed & capable of circumduction (ball & socket joint)  \n\u2022 two bones in the forearm, enabling rotation while providing stability  \n  \n\u2014 ulna firmly attached to elbow (loosely attached to wrist)  \n  \n\u2014 radius firmly attached to wrist (loosely attached to elbow)  \n\u2022 plantigrade contact with the ground  \n\u2022 multiple digits (typically five)   \n\u2022 unguis (nails, claws vs hoof)   \n  \nVarious anatomical adaptations for running (to enhance stride length/rate)  \n\u2022 mediolaterally flattened thorax with the scapula positioned laterally (which lengthens the \nlimb)   \n\u2022 scapula and shoulder joint free to move (shoulder becomes a hinge joint stabilized by \nmuscles)  \n\u2022 brachium remains highly muscular & relatively short (keeps limb mass proximal)  \n\u2022 one bone (radius) becomes dominant bone in the antebrachium (stability favoured over \nrotation)  \n\u2022 reduction of digits in the manus & pes (stability favoured over manipulative dexterity)  \n\u2022 conversion of musculature to ligament (reduced mass & more reliance on passive mechanics)  \n\u2022 elongation of the manus/pes (particularly the metacarpus/metatarsus and digits)   \n\u2022 ground contact made with digits (digitigrade) or hoof (unguligrade), vs plantigrade contact  \n  \n  \nForelimb - Hindlimb Comparison  \n  \nForelimbs and hindlimbs have different roles in cursorial quadrupeds. Consequently, \nthey are anatomically different:  \n  \nForelimbs (thoracic limbs) carry more static body weight (about 60%). Thoracic limbs are \ndesigned to catch body weight (mass x velocity) as it is thrown forward by the pelvic limbs. \nForelimbs are designed to improve gait efficiency by minimizing wasteful up/down energy \nexpenditure. (Ligaments absorb the kinetic energy of downward movement and store it as \n3  \npotential energy in stretched ligaments; then, during ligament rebound the stored energy is \nconverted to upward kinetic energy, elevating the thorax with minimal muscle involvement).   \n  \nAnatomical features of the forelimb include:  \n\u2022 shorter and straighter than the pelvic limb  \n\u2022 connected to the trunk only by muscle and ligament (not bone to bone articulation)  \n\u2022 broader, more rounded hoof (horse)  \n  \nHindlimbs (pelvic limbs) are the \"motors\" of locomotion. They drive the trunk forward and \npropel the body up/over obstacles during jumps. Anatomical features of the hindlimb include:  \n\u2022 longer and more angular than the thoracic limb  \n\u2022 osseous articulation to the trunk (axial skeleton) through a sacroiliac joint  \n\u2022 musculature capable of simultaneously extending hip, stifle, & hock  \n\u2022 narrower, more pointed hoof (horse)  \n  \n  \n  \nCarnivore vs Herbivore:   \n  \nThe carnivore lifestyle requires limb flexibility for grasping and manipulating prey and \nfor fighting to defend self, offspring, and territory. Thus, carnivores require multipurpose limbs \n(used for both running and manipulating). Therefore, anatomical specialization (limb \nelongation, bone reduction, digit elimination, conversion of muscle to ligament, and ungulate \nground contact) is moderated in the carnivore. Since the carnivore unguis (nail) is not used for \nlocomotion, it is available to be used as a \"tool/weapon\".   \n  \nCarnivores are fast because they have flexible spines. To catch long-leg prey, the \ncarnivore must obtain long stride length physiologically, by trunk flexion and extension (which \nrequires high energy expenditure). Trunk flexibility is feasible because carnivores have a \nrelatively small intestinal volume, due to a meat diet (which is why they need multipurpose \nlimbs in the first place).   \n  \n  \nHerbivores, with roughage diets and bulky abdominal viscera, have a more limited \ncapacity for trunk flexion. However, herbivore limbs, since they are not needed for grasping, are \nfreed to be devoted entirely to locomotion. Cursorial herbivores become ungulates, limbs make \nground contact with a hoof (unguis). The equine limb exhibits extreme anatomical \nspecialization for running.  \n  \n  \nEquine limbs have become so specialized, they resemble \"machines\" (reliance more on \nbone & ligament connections and less nerve & muscle control). The horse walks on the hoof of \na single digit of an elongated manus/pes where muscle has been replaced by ligament.   \n4  \n  \nIn contrast to ruminant herbivores (voluminous stomach for fermentation), the digestive \napparatus of the horse (small stomach and large cecum/colon for fermentation) predisposes it \nto continual grazing (in the wild). Accordingly, the horse has evolved ligament structures that \nfacilitate such a lifestyle, including prolonged standing with minimal expenditure of muscular \nenergy (stay apparatus), mechanical joint linkage (reciprocal apparatus), and mechanical energy \nconservation through potential/kinetic energy exchange (e.g., fetlock translation).  \n  \n  \n  \nAlimentary modifications   \n  \n  \nThe alimentary tract consists of oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large \nintestine, including cecum and anal canal. As mentioned, the different alimentary tracts and \ndiets of domestic mammals have implications for behaviour and thus locomotion. Features of \nthree types of digestive tracts are presented below:  \n  \nCanine digestive tract  \n\u2022 simple glandular stomach  \n\u2022 small cecum and simple colon  \n\u2022 small abdominal volume, especially when fasted  \n\u2022 high protein diet   \n  \nRuminant digestive tract (cattle, sheep, goat, deer, etc.)   \n\u2022 huge stomach with four compartments (fermentation chambers and a glandular \ncompartment)  \n\u2022 large cecum and coiled ascending colon  \n\u2022 large abdominal volume even if fasted  \n\u2022 rumen flora and fermentation products supplement a roughage diet  \n  \nEquine digestive tract  \n\u2022 simple stomach (half glandular)  \n\u2022 huge cecum and ascending colon  \n\u2022 large abdominal volume even if fasted  \n\u2022 roughage diet requires a protein source (obtained via grain or in the wild, coprophagy)"
