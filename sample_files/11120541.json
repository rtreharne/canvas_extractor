  "text": "Scenario One\nAn owner no longer wishes to keep their healthy pet dog and takes it to a local animal rescue centre for rehoming. Unfortunately there is a large stray dog population locally and the shelter is already full. Consider the potential options for the animal shelter in this situation.\nScenario Two\nAn elderly owner has a cat which has had vomiting and diarrhoea over the last few weeks. When he takes the cat to the vet he is advised that the cat need further diagnostic tests and treatment. The owner is unable to afford the suggested tests. What are the options for the owner and vet in this situation?\nScenario Three\nA multi-national drug company has discovered a new chemotherapy drug which in-vitro tests have shown will kill neoplastic (cancer) cells. The company needs to decide what the next stage in testing will be. They are currently considering animal testing.\nFor all scenarios consider the options and stakeholders involved.\nHow do ethical principles impact these options?\nWhat would be the consequences of each of the options?\nThere will be time in our next session to discuss these scenarios in groups."
